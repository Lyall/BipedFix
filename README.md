This BepinEx plugin for the game Biped adds support for:
- Playing the game in any ultrawide aspect ratios such as 21:9, 32:9 or even higher.
- Unlocked FPS and forcing vsync.
- Fixing various issues caused by running at unsupported resolutions.
- Setting an arbitrary resolution.

## Installation
- Grab the latest release of BipedFix from https://github.com/Lyall/BipedFix/releases
- Extract the contents of **BipedFix zip** in to the game directory (e.g. steamapps/common/Biped).
- Run Biped once to generate a config file located at Biped/BepinEx/config/BipedFix.cfg

## Configuration
- See the generated BipedFix.cfg to adjust various aspects of the plugin.

## Known Issues
Please report any issues you see and I'll do my best to fix them.

- The current implementation of the fix for the save dialog is imperfect and results in the "Saving" dialog being misaligned.
