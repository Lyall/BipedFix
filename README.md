# BipedFix
This BepinEx plugin for the game Biped adds support for:
- Playing the game in any ultrawide aspect ratios such as 21:9, 32:9 or even higher.
- Unlocked FPS and forcing vsync.
- Setting an arbitrary resolution.

## Installation
- Run once to generate a config file. 
- Edit config file to adjust the various settings of the mod.

## Known Issues
Please report any issues you see and I'll do my best to fix them.

- The current implementation of the fix for the save dialog is imperfect and results in the "Saving" dialog being misaligned.
